# Connect4
This is our Connect 4 game!

Here are the steps to play Connect 4:

1. Decide who will go first
2. Player 1 chooses a color/token and takes all the pieces of that color. Player 2 takes the other color/token.
3. Player 1 drops one of their pieces into any slot on the board. The piece will fall to the lowest unoccupied slot in that column.
4. Player 2 then takes a turn and drops one of their pieces into any slot on the board.
5. The players take turns dropping pieces onto the board until one of them gets four of their pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
6. The first player to get four in a row wins the game.
7. To play Connect 4 with someone, you simply follow these steps while taking turns dropping your pieces onto the board. Keep in mind that you need to try to block your opponent's attempts to get four in a row while simultaneously attempting to get your own four in a row. Good luck and have fun!
